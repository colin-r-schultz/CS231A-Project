To see our implementations of the optimization problems presented in our report, see the following functions:

* `singlebody_sfm` in `sfm.py` (Spatial Clustering method)

* `multibody_sfm` in `continuous_sfm.py` (Direct Optimization method)

* `sfm_features` in `grad_features.py` (Gradient Features method)

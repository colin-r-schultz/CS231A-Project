# Object Segmentation via Multibody Structure from Motion
By Aaron and Colin Schultz

[Written report](/CS231A_Project_Final_Paper.pdf)

To see our implementations of the optimization problems presented in our report, see the following functions:

* `singlebody_sfm` in `sfm.py` (Spatial Clustering method)

* `multibody_sfm` in `continuous_sfm.py` (Direct Optimization method)

* `sfm_features` in `grad_features.py` (Gradient Features method)
